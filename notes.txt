// STATE = > IS AN INTERNAL OBJECT OF A COMPONENT
// IT IS USED TO STORE DATA THAT CAN CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN RESPONSE TO USER ACTIONS
// WHEN STATE CHANGES, THE COMPONENT RE-RENDERS TO REFLECT THE UPDATED DATA
// usestate return an array with two elements, a value and a function to update that value

//event handlers
// onclick = { increment }  // this is an event handler
// onscroll = { handleScroll }  // this is an event handler
// onchange = { handleChange }  // this is an event handler

// Hooks =>> functions, that are used to copy the lifecycle methods of class components


// RE RENDERING
// when a component re renders, it means that the component is being re-evaluated and
// its output is being updated based on changes in state or props
// when a component re renders, react compares the new output with the previous output

// FOLDER STRUCTURE 
// public =>> index.html, assets like images, fonts, icons
// src =>> all the code files, components, styles, utils, services, hooks
// node_modules =>> all the dependencies and packages
// package.json =>> all the metadata about the project, scripts, dependencies
// vite.config.js =>> configuration file for vite


// VITE VS CRA
// VITE IS A BUILD TOOL THAT PROVIDES A FAST DEVELOPMENT ENVIRONMENT FOR MODERN WEB
// APPLICATIONS. IT USES ES MODULES AND BROWSER NATIVE IMPORTS TO PROVID

// NPM VS NPX VS YARN
// NPM =>> NODE PACKAGE MANAGER, IT IS USED TO MANAGE THE DEPEND

// VARIABLES VS STATE
// VARIABLES ARE USED TO STORE DATA THAT DOES NOT CHANGE OVER TIME
// STATE IS USED TO STORE DATA THAT CAN CHANGE OVER TIME OR IN RESPONSE TO USER ACTIONS
// WHEN STATE CHANGES, THE COMPONENT RE-RENDERS TO REFLECT THE UPDATED DATA

// FUNCTION REUSE IN REACT
// you can reuse functions in react by defining them outside the componeNT or if we want to use them in a same compoenent we can define them before the return statement




props,  Routes and Routing, Basic Form handling with state. 



// we use react router dom for routing in react

// Absolute Link=> this is for complete new routes or apps >
// Relative Link = > this is for relative to the application /profile

// conditional rendering => this is for rendering components based on certain conditions WE USE ? (ternary) FOR CONDITIONS

// React Router Dom => it is used for routing in react js
//Browser Router
// Routes,Route, Link
// path=> used to define the route path
// element = > used to store the element where we want to go
